# Summary
Creating React components and documenting them. 
The end goal is to develop not so hard components which are tested with unit/integration/e2e tests. 
- have code snippets that can be applied to a React project without any effort and immeadiatelly to see the result of a working component
- provide examples for different use cases and so on.
- each component should be installed separately
- for now at least the idea is not to create a components library, but small components that are dead simple to use.
